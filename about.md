<p> My name is Nithin Bobbiligama, and I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Dayton, Which i completed in May 2023. With over 5+ years of experience as a Data Engineer, I have worked across healthcare, insurance, and financial domains, specializing in building and optimizing scalable data pipelines. 

Currently, I am working as an Azure Data Engineer at Nationwide in Columbus, In this role, I've contributed to the modernization of enterprise data systems by designing and optimizing ETL pipelines with Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse to power real-time reporting use cases. I have developed event-driven architectures using Azure Functions and Kafka, automated ingestion frameworks with Python to reduce data latency, and delivered interactive dashboards in Power BI that improved business decision-making. I also set up CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps to ensure faster, more reliable deployments.

Previously, I contributed to Humana’s healthcare analytics by implementing real-time pipelines ,and optimizing for cost efficiency, and integrating REST APIs for faster dashboards. 

I am passionate about solving complex data problems, enabling real-time insights, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver business-driven analytics solutions. I am seeking full-time opportunities where I can continue to innovate as a data engineer and contribute to impactful, cloud-native data initiatives.
